            <figcaption>I'm from Orem, Utah. A city just north of Provo, Utah which is a little more well known. 
                        In the southern end of Utah valley you'll find a not too busy group of cities and plenty of suburban neighborhoods.
                        The people in Orem that I've had the please of growing up around are very kind and thoughtful. It was a great place to grow up.
                        It's close to the mountains and so has great hiking spots and within a few hours drive you can reach some amazing camping and backpacking trails.
                        In the winter we get a good amount of snow, not too much but enough to have a good time. And finally we have something like 10 beautiful temples
                        all within a 30 minutes drive.

            <!--How I got into the TES program-->
            <h2>How I got here:</h2>
            <p>I'm a junior per BYU, but this is my first semester taking any TES core classes. I began my academic journey after my mission in Fall 2021. 
                But after my first semester I learned that school isn't my strong suit. I worked in the BYU live audio team throughout this time at BYU and 
                during my third semester I got a job offer as an audio engineer and I took it. I left BYU and worked in Salt Lake for a few years. I gained
                a lot of experience and found some success in my career and in real estate. I decided to take the lead I gained and go back to school. I chose 
                TES as it is the program that will help me develop many applicable skills while completing this bachelor's degree.

            <h2>Where I'm going:</h2>
            <p>After completing the TES program, I plan to go back to work as an audio engineer, but this time I hope to work for an institution, hopefully BYU. 
                This would allow me to have a more stable work life and I'll be able to give more to my family. I plan to continue my inveestment work in real estate
                and hopefully give more and more time to my wife and my kids.
